HOW TO STAY AWAKE AT MEETINGS

1. Before (or during) your next meeting, seminar, or conference call, prepare yourself by drawing a square. I find that 5"x 5" is a good size. Divide the card into columns, five across and five down. That will give you 25 one inch blocks.

2. Write one of the following words/phrases in each block:

    * synergy
    * strategic fit
    * core competencies
    * best practice
    * bottom line
    * revisit
    * take that off-line
    * 24/7
    * out of the loop
    * benchmark
    * value-added
    * pro-active
    * win-win
    * think outside the box
    * fast track
    * result-driven
    * empower (or empowerment)
    * knowledge base
    * at the end of the day
    * touch base
    * mind-set
    * client focus(ed)
    * paradigm
    * game plan
    * leverage

and last but not least

    * MOVING FORWARD......

3. Check off the appropriate block when you hear one of those words/phrases.

4. When you get five blocks horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, stand up and shout "BULLSHIT!"
