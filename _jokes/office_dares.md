OFFICE DARES

ONE-POINT OFFICE DARES
1) Run one lap around the office at top speed.
3) Ignore the first five people who say 'good morning' to you.
4) Phone someone in the office you barely know, leave your name and say, "Just called to say I can't talk right now. Bye."
5) Leave your zipper open for one hour. If anyone points it out, say, "Sorry, I really prefer it this way". Walk sideways to the photocopier.
7) While riding in a lift, gasp dramatically every time the doors open.

THREE-POINTS DARES
1) Say to your boss, "I like your style" and shoot him withdouble-barrelled fingers.
2) Babble incoherently at a fellow employee then ask, "Did you get all that, I don't want to have to repeat it".
3) Page yourself over the intercom (do not disguise your voice).
4) Kneel in front of the water cooler and drink directly from the nozzle (there must be a 'non-player' within sight).

FIVE POINT DARES
1) At the end of a meeting, suggest that, for once, it would be nice to conclude with the singing of the National Anthem (extra points if you actually launch into it yourself).
2) For an hour, refer to everyone you speak to as "Bob".
3) Announce to everyone in a meeting that you "really have to go do a number two".
4) After every sentence, say 'Mon' in a really bad Jamaican accent. As in "the report's on your desk, Mon". Keep this up fo r one hour.
5) While an office mate is out, move their chair into the lift.
6) In a colleague's diary, write in 10am: "See how I look in tights".
9) Carry your keyboard over to your colleague and ask "You wanna trade?".
10) Repeat the following conversation 10 times to the same person: "Do you hear that?" "What?" "Never mind, it's gone now".
11) Come to work in army fatigues and when asked why, say, "I can't talk about it".
12) Posing as a maitre d', call a colleague and tell him he's won a lunch for four at a local restaurant. Let him go.
13) Find the vacuum and start vacuuming around your desk.
14) Hang a two-foot long piece of toilet roll from the back of your pants and act genuinely surprised when someone points it out.
15) Move your work desk and chair into the lift and when the doors open say "Hello, can I help you???".

And if that wasn't enough for you...

SEVEN POINT DARES
1) At lunchtime, sit in your parked car with sunglasses on and point a hairdryer at passing cars. See if they slow down.
2) Tell your children over dinner. "Due to the eco nomy, we are going to have to let one of you go."
3) Put your rubbish bin on your desk and label it "IN."
4) Put decaf in the coffee maker for 3 weeks. Once everyone has gotten over his or her caffeine addictions, switch to espresso.
5) As often as possible, skip rather than walk.
6) Specify that your drive-through order is "to go."
7) Sing along at the opera.
8) Go to a poetry recital and ask why the poems don't rhyme.
9) Five days in advance, tell your friends you can't attend their party because you're not in the mood.
10) Have your co-workers address you by your wrestling name, Rock Hard.
11) When the money comes out of the ATM, scream "I Won! I Won! 3rd time this week!!!"
12) When leaving the zoo, start running towards the parking lot yelling, "Run for your lives, they're loose!"
